// The safety classification of a single CLI action for the MCP server. Every
// action reachable from the CLI action tree resolves to exactly one of these
// before it can be surfaced as an MCP tool.
//
//  - SURFACE: read-only. Always exposed. Node-local reads are surfaced but
//             tagged (see DispositionInfo::node_local) because they only mean
//             anything when the server runs on that node.
//  - GATED:   cluster mutation. Hidden unless --allow-writes is set; surfaced
//             with a host confirm prompt and dry-run.
//  - REJECT:  blocking / never-promptly-returning. Would freeze the
//             single-threaded serve loop (long-running admin ops and daemon
//             launchers). Never surfaced in v1.
//  - EXCLUDE: interactive (drives an editor / stdin) or node-local mutating.
//             Never surfaced.
//
// The underlying type is pinned to uint8_t so the enum is stored compactly on
// each Action. tool_action.h forward-declares it (enum class Disposition :
// uint8_t;) to hold it by value without depending on this header;

// the action carries no disposition (the caller must not surface such an
// action).
//
// Actions under the "test" mode (KUDU_CLI_TEST_TOOL_ENABLED test-only tooling)

// consulting the action, so the coverage invariant does not require test
// tooling to be classified.

// carries a disposition (actions under the "test" mode are treated as EXCLUDE

// full command path if an action is not classified.
//
// This is the Status-returning form, suitable for unit tests. The MCP serve
// startup path should use ValidateDispositionCoverageOrDie() instead so a newly
// added but unclassified CLI action fails loudly and immediately.
