// Interprets a finished child tool process into an MCP tool result. 'wait_status'
// is the raw waitpid() status (meaningful only when !timed_out); 'timed_out' is
// true if the child was killed for exceeding its deadline. A clean exit (code 0)
// yields the child's stdout as the (non-error) result. Any other outcome -- a
// non-zero exit, death by signal (e.g. a CHECK / LOG(FATAL) abort in a CLI action
// written for the run-once world), or a timeout -- is a tool-execution error: it
// is reported as isError=true text rather than being allowed to take down the
// long-lived server. The child's stderr (the action's own diagnostics) is
// preferred for the error text, falling back to stdout when stderr is empty.
//
// Declared here (external linkage) so the itest can exercise the exit-0 /
// non-zero / signal / timeout paths deterministically without spawning a real
// crashing binary.
